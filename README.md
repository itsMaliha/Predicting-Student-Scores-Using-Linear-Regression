# Supervised Learning - Predicting Student Scores using Linear Regression
In this repository, we use linear regression to predict the scores based on number of hours studied. This is a fairly elementary code which uses only two variables: hours and scores. The scores are the dependent variable which we are predicting based on the number of hours studied.
Inorder to understand the data outlined in this repository it is important to understand various keywords in context with this example.

# Supervised Learning
Supervised Learning is one the two main Machine Learning algorithms used to map certain set of inputs to certain outputs. This kind of data is called labeled data. The system istold what to look for.
Consider our case, we have a set of data with two columns, one containing number of hours studied and the other containing scores. As we want to predict the score therefore we call it label (output) and the number of hours each student studied as input.
